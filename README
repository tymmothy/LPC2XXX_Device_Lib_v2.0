This is a library for using the LPC2000 series of chips.  Presently there
is support for LPC2101/2/3, LPC2104/5/6, LPC2131/2/4/6/8, and basic support
for LPC2141/2/4/6/8 microcontrollers.  So far work has been with GCC compilers,
though it should be easy to port to others.

Most peripherals have base-level functions available (exceptions at present:
I2C, USB).

The format of this is meant to be similar to CMSIS interfaces for newer,
Cortex-based MCUs to allow for easy forward / back porting.

Almost all functions are defined as static inlines; this is primarily for
speed, though it can certainly complicate debugging (I've run into issues
with vendors libraries being much too slow, especially when using functions
in interrupt handlers -- this is one of the big reasons I chose to start
rolling my own libraries).

This library is released under a Simplified BSD license.
